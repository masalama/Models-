**AppInstallParams**

The `AppInstallParams` class represents the settings for the custom authorization URL of an application. It contains the following attributes:

- **scopes:** A list of OAuth2 scopes to add the application to a guild with.
- **permissions:** The permissions to give to the application in the guild.

**Constructor:**

```python
def __init__(self, data: InstallParamsPayload) -> None:
    self.scopes: List[str] = data.get('scopes', [])
    self.permissions: Permissions = Permissions(int(data['permissions']))
```

**IntegrationTypeConfig**

The `IntegrationTypeConfig` class represents the default settings for the application's installation context. It contains the following attribute:

- **oauth2_install_params:** The install params for this installation context's default in-app authorization link.

**Constructor:**

```python
def __init__(self, data: AppIntegrationTypeConfigPayload) -> None:
    self.oauth2_install_params: Optional[AppInstallParams] = None
    try:
        self.oauth2_install_params = AppInstallParams(data['oauth2_install_params'])  # type: ignore # EAFP
    except KeyError:
        pass
```

**Usage:**

```python
# Get the installation type config from the Discord API
config = client.get_application_installation_type_config(application_id)

# Access the oauth2_install_params attribute
if config.oauth2_install_params:
    print("Scopes:", config.oauth2_install_params.scopes)
    print("Permissions:", config.oauth2_install_params.permissions)
```

  "response": "The provided text is a Python code snippet that defines classes and their attributes related to applications in the Discord API. The classes include `AppInstallParams`, `IntegrationTypeConfig`, and `App` (which is mentioned but not fully defined in the snippet). These classes are used to manage and interact with application settings such as permissions, OAuth2 scopes, and installation parameters.\n\n- `AppInstallParams` class represents the settings for custom authorization URL of an application. It includes a list of OAuth2 scopes and permissions.\n- `IntegrationTypeConfig` class represents the default settings for the application's installation context, which can include OAuth2 install parameters.\n- The snippet also mentions classes like `Asset`, `ApplicationFlags`, and `Permissions`, which are used to represent additional properties of applications, such as icons, flags, and permissions respectively.\n\nThe purpose of these classes is to provide a structured way to work with application data in the Discord API, allowing developers to easily manage and manipulate application settings programmatically."

### Documentation Output from codeqwen

这段代码是 Discord.py 的部分实现，主要涉及 `AppInstallParams` 和 `IntegrationTypeConfig` 类。`AppInstallParams` 类用于封装自定义授权链接的设置信息，包括授权范围（scopes）和权限（permissions）。而 `IntegrationTypeConfig` 类则用于表示应用程序安装上下文中默认的 OAuth2 安装参数配置。

在 Discord.py 中，通常不会直接创建或使用这些类来管理应用程序的授权设置，而是通过 API 来更新应用的相关信息，如 `Bot.update_application_info()` 方法。

**Connectable Class**

The `Connectable` class is an abstract base class (ABC) that provides a common interface for connecting to voice and stage channels. It is implemented by the `VoiceChannel` and `StageChannel` classes.

**connect() Method**

The `connect()` method is used to connect to a voice server. It takes the following parameters:

- `timeout`: The timeout in seconds to wait for the connection to complete.
- `reconnect`: Whether the bot should automatically reconnect if a connection error occurs.
- `cls`: The type of voice client to use. Defaults to `VoiceClient`.
- `self_deaf`: Whether the client should be self-deafened.
- `self_mute`: Whether the client should be self-muted.

The method raises a `asyncio.TimeoutError` if the connection times out, a `ClientException` if the client is already connected to a voice channel, and an `OpusNotLoaded` exception if the opus library is not loaded.

**_get_voice_client_key() and _get_voice_state_pair() Methods**

These methods are used internally by the `Connectable` class to retrieve the voice client key and voice state pair for a specific channel.

**Usage**

To connect to a voice channel, simply call the `connect()` method on an instance of `VoiceChannel` or `StageChannel`:

```python
channel = client.get_channel(channel_id)
voice_client = await channel.connect()
```

**Note:**

- The `voice_states` intent must be enabled for the bot to connect to voice channels.
- The `opus` library must be installed and loaded.

### Documentation Output from codeqwen

This is an ABC for channel classes in the Discord library, specifically those which can connect to a voice server. The `Connectable` protocol has methods that are needed for connecting and disconnecting from a voice channel.

1. `_get_voice_client_key()`: This method should return a tuple containing the ID of the channel along with a string indicating the type of voice client, e.g., 'stage', 'text', etc.
   
2. `_get_voice_state_pair()`: this method should return a tuple containing two IDs: one representing the guild and another representing the user. This is used to identify the user's voice state in the guild.

3. `connect()`: this coroutine function connects to the voice server, creates an instance of `VoiceClient` (or a subclass), and returns it as a connected client. It handles connecting, reconnecting, and error checking.

The `connect()` method has parameters that are optional for customizing the behavior of the connection process:

- `timeout`: How long to wait before timing out the connection attempt.
- `reconnect`: A boolean indicating whether the bot should automatically retry if a handshake fails or the gateway goes down.
- `cls`: The class that will be used to create the voice client, defaults to `VoiceClient`.
- `self_deaf` and `self_mute`: Boolean flags for setting the user's audio settings when connecting.

The function returns an instance of a subclass of `VoiceProtocol`, which is likely a wrapper around the actual WebSocket connection to the voice server. If the connection fails, it disconnects and raises an exception.
