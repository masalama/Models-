### Documentation Output from codegemma

**Summary**

The code snippet provides a Python representation of the Discord API entities for an application, including its settings, permissions, and installation parameters.

**Key Classes:**

* **App:** Represents an application object with attributes like ID, name, description, icon, flags, etc.
* **AppInstallParams:** Represents the settings for custom authorization URL of an application, including scopes and permissions.
* **IntegrationTypeConfig:** Represents the default settings for an application's installation context, including OAuth2 install params.

**Usage**

The classes can be used to access and work with application data retrieved from the Discord API. For example, you can use the `icon` property to retrieve the application's icon asset, or the `scopes` attribute of an `AppInstallParams` object to get the list of authorized scopes.

**Example**

```python
# Get an application object
app = App(state=connection_state, data=app_data)

# Print the application name
print(app.name)

# Get the list of authorized scopes
scopes = app.install_params.scopes

# Check if the application can manage guilds
can_manage_guilds = app.install_params.permissions.manage_guilds
```

**Additional Features**

* The code includes support for missing data in the API response.
* The `ApplicationFlags` class allows for easy access to different application flags.
* The `Asset` class can be used to retrieve assets associated with an application.

**Conclusion**

This code provides a comprehensive and well-structured representation of Discord API entities for applications, making it easier to work with application data and functionality.

Use python to solve the following problems.

Question:
Given an array of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].
Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
Example 3:
Input: nums = [-1,3,2,0]
Output: true
Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].
Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Instruction: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs). Enclose your code within delimiters as follows.
```python3
# YOUR CODE HERE

### Documentation Output from codegemma

**Connectable Protocol**

The provided code defines a protocol named `Connectable`. It provides an abstract method called `connect()` that is used to connect to a voice server.

**Usage**

The `Connectable` protocol is intended to be implemented by classes that represent voice channels or stage channels. These classes must provide an implementation for the `connect()` method.

**`connect()` Method**

The `connect()` method takes several parameters:

- `timeout`: The maximum time to wait for the connection to establish.
- `reconnect`: Whether the client should automatically reconnect if there are any errors.
- `cls`: A custom class that extends `VoiceClient`.
- `self_deaf`: Whether the client should be self-deafened.
- `self_mute`: Whether the client should be self-muted.

The method performs the following steps:

1. Checks if the client is already connected to a voice channel.
2. Creates a new `VoiceClient` instance.
3. Connects to the voice server using the specified parameters.
4. Returns the `VoiceClient` instance.

**Implementation**

The `VoiceChannel` and `StageChannel` classes in Discord.py implement the `Connectable` protocol and provide their own implementations for the `connect()` method.

**Example**

```python
# Connect to a voice channel
voice_channel = client.get_channel(voice_channel_id)
voice_client = await voice_channel.connect()

# Check if the client is connected
if voice_client.is_connected():
    print("Connected to voice channel.")
```

**Note:**

- The `Intents.voice_states` intent must be enabled for the bot to connect to voice channels.
- The `opus` library must be installed for the `VoiceClient` to function properly.

### Documentation Output from codeqwen

在 Discord.py 中，`Connectable` 是一个协议（Protocol），它定义了一些用于连接到语音服务器的通用操作。这个协议被以下几个类实现了：

- `VoiceChannel`
- `StageChannel`

实现 `Connectable` 的类的共性方法包括：

1. `_get_voice_client_key()`：返回一个元组，其中包含用于唯一标识该通道的 ID 和类型。
2. `_get_voice_state_pair()`：返回一个元组，包含用于在服务器端跟踪用户连接状态的 IDs。
3. `connect()`：异步方法，用于连接到语音频道并创建一个 `VoiceClient` 实例来控制与服务器的连接。

在使用这些类的客户端程序中，通常需要调用 `VoiceChannel.connect()` 方法来建立与 Discord 语音服务器的连接，例如：

```python
client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def onReady():
    # 在用户准备好之后连接语音频道
    vc: discord.VoiceProtocol = await client.get_channel(1234567890).connect()  # 替换为你的频道 ID
    await vc.send('欢迎加入我们的频道！')

client.run("your-token-here")
```

这段代码首先创建了一个 `Client` 实例，并在 `OnReady` 事件触发时尝试连接到指定的语音频道。请注意，你需要替换 `1234567890` 为实际的频道 ID，并确保你的 bot 有相应的权限和作用域来连接到语音服务器。
