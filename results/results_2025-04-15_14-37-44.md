### Documentation Output from codegemma

The provided code snippet appears to be related to the Discord API and its functionality. It defines several classes and data structures that represent aspects of an application, including its settings, permissions, and installation configuration.

**Here's a breakdown of the code:**

**Classes:**

- **App:** Represents an entire Discord application, including its name, description, icon, cover image, and flags.
- **AppInstallParams:** Represents the settings for the application's custom authorization URL, including the scopes and permissions.
- **IntegrationTypeConfig:** Represents the default settings for the application's installation context, including the oauth2 installation parameters.

**Data Structures:**

- **PartialAppInfoPayload:** Represents a partial version of the application data returned by the Discord API.
- **InstallParamsPayload:** Represents the data for the application's installation parameters.
- **AppIntegrationTypeConfigPayload:** Represents the data for the application's integration type configuration.

**Key Features:**

- The code provides a structured way to represent the essential details of a Discord application and its installation configuration.
- It includes classes that encapsulate relevant information, such as the application name, description, icon, scopes, permissions, and flags.
- The code also provides data structures to represent the raw data returned by the Discord API.

**Overall, this code snippet showcases the use of Python classes and data structures to model the complex data associated with Discord applications and their installation configurations.**

**Additional Notes:**

- The code uses the `ConnectionState` object to access the Discord API.
- The `Asset` class is not included in the code snippet, but it is likely used to represent the application's icon and cover image.
- The `ApplicationFlags` enum is not included in the code snippet, but it is likely used to represent the application's flags.

### Documentation Output from qwen2.5-coder

This code defines several classes and data models related to applications in the Discord API, such as `App`, `PartialAppInfo`, `AppInstallParams`, and `IntegrationTypeConfig`. Each class represents a different aspect of an application, including its metadata, permissions, install parameters, and configuration settings.

1. **Application Class**: Represents a full application with detailed attributes like name, description, icon, cover image, and flags.

2. **PartialAppInfo Class**: Simplified version of the Application class containing only essential information such as id, name, description, and icons.

3. **AppInstallParams Class**: Holds settings for custom authorization URLs including scopes and permissions.

4. **IntegrationTypeConfig Class**: Contains configuration details specifically for how applications integrate within Discord servers (guilds).

These classes are used throughout the Discord.py library to interact with application data programmatically using asynchronous requests through the Discord API.

### Documentation Output from codeqwen

This is a Python code snippet that defines classes for Discord applications and their components, such as connection state, partial application information, asset management, permissions, and authorization settings.

1. `ConnectionState`: This class represents the current state of the client's connection to Discord, providing methods for accessing and managing resources.

2. `PartialAppInfoPayload`: a data type used as an input or output parameter in the creation of the `PartialAppInfo` class. It is a dictionary containing partial information about an application.

3. `PartialAppInfo`: this class represents a simplified version of an application, with only some of its details available. It has attributes like ID, name, icon, flags, description, rpc origins, verification key, terms of service URL, privacy policy URL, approximate guild count, redirect URIs for OAuth2 authorization, interactions endpoint URL, and role connections verification URL.

4. `AppInstallParams`: a class that represents the parameters for custom authorization URL of an application. It has attributes like scopes and permissions.

5. `IntegrationTypeConfig`: A class representing the default settings for an application's installation context. It has an attribute `oauth2_install_params`, which is an optional instance of `AppInstallParams`.

The code includes a docstring with information about each class, its attributes, and how it's used in the Discord ecosystem.

### Documentation Output from codegemma

**Connectable Class**

The `Connectable` class is an abstract base class that defines the common operations for connecting to a voice server. It is implemented by the `VoiceChannel` and `StageChannel` classes.

**connect() Method**

The `connect()` method connects to voice and creates a `VoiceClient` object. It takes the following parameters:

- `timeout`: The timeout in seconds to wait for the connection to complete.
- `reconnect`: Whether the bot should automatically reconnect if the connection fails.
- `cls`: The type of voice client to use. Defaults to `VoiceClient`.
- `self_deaf`: Whether the client should be self-deafened.
- `self_mute`: Whether the client should be self-muted.

**Implementation**

The `connect()` method first checks if the client is already connected to a voice channel. If not, it creates a new `VoiceClient` object and connects to the voice server. The method handles timeouts and exceptions appropriately.

**Usage**

To connect to a voice channel, you can use the `connect()` method on a `VoiceChannel` or `StageChannel` object. For example:

```python
channel = client.get_channel(channel_id)
voice_client = await channel.connect()
```

**Additional Notes**

- The `_get_voice_client_key()` and `_get_voice_state_pair()` methods are used to retrieve the voice client key and state pair for the connected voice client.
- The `VoiceClient` class is responsible for establishing the connection to the voice server and managing the voice state.
- The `opus` library is required for voice communication.
- The `Intents.voice_states` intent must be enabled for the bot to connect to voice channels.

  "response": "The provided text is a Python code snippet that defines two abstract base classes, `Connectable` and `GuildChannel`. The `Connectable` class provides an interface for objects that can connect to a voice server, such as `VoiceChannel` and `StageChannel`.

### Documentation Output from codeqwen

It seems like you've provided a code snippet from the Discord.py library, specifically focusing on the `Connectable` protocol and its related functionality. The `Connectable` protocol is used by channels like `VoiceChannel` and `StageChannel` to provide common methods for connecting them to voice servers.

Here's what each method in the `Connectable` protocol does:

1. **\_get_voice_client_key()** - This method should return a tuple consisting of two elements. The first element is an integer representing the ID of the channel, and the second element is a string indicating the type of voice client to create (e.g., 'voice', 'stage').

2. **\_get_voice_state_pair()** - this method returns a tuple containing the IDs of both the channel and the user's voice state. It's used internally by Discord to determine if the user has joined this voice channel.

3. **connect(timeout: float = 30.0, reconnect: bool = True, cls: Callable[[Client, Connectable], T] = VoiceClient, self_deaf: bool = False, self_mute: bool = False)** - A coroutine that connects to the voice server using the provided parameters. It creates a new instance of the specified `cls` (defaulting to `VoiceClient`) and then proceeds with connecting to the voice channel. If it fails to connect within the given timeout, it raises an asyncio.TimeoutError.

Overall, this protocol allows for a common interface for interacting with voice channels in Discord, enabling various functionalities such as joining and disconnecting from voice chat.
